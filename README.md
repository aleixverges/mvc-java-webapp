# mvc-java-webapp
MVC Java Web Application. Technical test

NOTE: If I had more time I would like to spend it investigating more around RX Java technology and also do more unit 
testing for some classes like View or ParameterFilter classes for example.

To login into the application you can use the following credentials 

 user1 password:user1 role:page1  
 
 user2 password:user2 role:page2  
 
 user3 password:user3 role:page3  

You can find the JAR artifact at /out/artifacts/shibsted.jar
